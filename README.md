**My Favorite Series**
*Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo*
Scarlet Heart Ryeo  is a South Korean television series which is about a woman from the 21st century gets caught in a solar eclipse and transported back in time to the Goryeo Dynasty.in the body of 16-year-old girl. There she witnesses love, rivalry, politics, and friendships ensue between the handsome princes, in a fight for the throne, friendship, and love.
this story made me smile, laugh, and fall in love with princes while also ripping my heart apart because of its tragic ending. Nevertheless, this is definitely worth to watch.
